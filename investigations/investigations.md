# Investigations

Investigation documents are meant to hold as much context as possible about what is hoping to be accomplished and any
information that is useful in determining why/how it should be done. Investigation documents don't need to house all the
data themselves, but can/should instead link to things like wikis/lucidcharts that are found during the investigation.

## Assumptions/Knowns/Unknowns

The investigation should be sectioned in to things that we know, assume, and can't/don't know. This allows us to
determine the likely success of the endeavor given that taking action on a lot of knowns is much more likely to be
successful than taking action on a lot of unknowns.
